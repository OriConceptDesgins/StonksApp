# StonksApp

Slightly diviates from the requirements because I wanted to add also the stock name and the exchange its traded on to give more context.  I used bootstrap 5 for the CSS part and customized it slightly. 
Didn't use font-awesome but I see that I can also download it as an SVG so I might do that next time.
